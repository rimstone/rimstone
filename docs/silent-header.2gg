.SH PURPOSE
Do not output HTTP headers.

.SH SYNTAX

silent-header

.SH DESCRIPTION
silent-header will suppress the output of HTTP headers, such as with \fBout-header\fP, or in any other case where headers are output. The effect applies to current \fBrequest\fP only; if you use it conditionally, then you can have it on or off dynamically. 

If you want to suppress the headers for all \fBservice handlers\fP (as if silent-header were implied at the beginning of each), then for a \fBcommand-line\fP program, use "--silent-header" option in "gg -r" when running it; to suppress the headers in \fBservice\fPs, use "-z" option in \fBmgrg\fP.

silent-header must be used prior to outputting headers, meaning either prior to any output (if out-header is not used) or prior to first out-header.

There are many uses for silent-header, among them:
