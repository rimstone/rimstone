.SH DESCRIPTION
delete-fifo will delete all leading elements from the FIFO <list> up to the last one read, including. <list> was created by \fBnew-fifo\fP. 

Right after \fBrewind-fifo\fP, no element was read yet, and delete-fifo will have no effect. After any \fBread-fifo\fP, delete-fifo wil delete all elements up to the element read, including that element.

.SH EXAMPLES

.RS 4
.EX

new-fifo mylist

// Add data to the list
write-fifo mylist key "key1" value "value1"
write-fifo mylist key "some2" value "other2"

// Get first data from the list
read-fifo mylist key k value v

// Delete first element from the list, so list will have only "some2" key
delete-fifo mylist
