.SH NAME
set-param \-  (request-data)
.SH PURPOSE
Set or create a parameter.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

set-param ( <name> [ = <value> ] ) , ...

.EE
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
set-param sets or creates parameter <name> (see \fBget-param\fP). 

If parameter <name> does not exist, it's created with <value>. If it does exist, its value is replaced with <value>. Note that <value> can be of any type. 

If equal sign ("=") and <value> are omitted, then <value> is the same as <name>, so:

.RS 4
.EX

set-param something

.EE
.RE

is the same as:

.RS 4
.EX

set-param something = something

.EE
.RE

where the first "something" is the parameter set/created, and the second "something" is an actual variable in your code. In this example, the two just happen to have the same name; this generally happens often, so this form is a shortcut for that.

You can specify any number of parameters separated by a comma, for instance in this case par1 is a boolean, par2 is a number and par3 is a string:

.RS 4
.EX

set-number par2 = 10
set-param par1=true, par, par3="hi"

.EE
.RE


.SH EXAMPLES
Set the value of parameter "quantity" to "10", which is also the output:

.RS 4
.EX

set-param quantity = "10"
\[char46]..
get-param quantity
print-out quantity

.EE
.RE
