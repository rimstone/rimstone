Client-API \- RimStone documentation (API)
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can use C API client library to connect to RimStone:

.RS 4
\[bu]    
The API has only a few functions, and the main one is "rim_cli_request()", which makes a call to the service.

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
There is only a single data type used, which is "rim_cli" and it is used to specify a request and its options, as well as to retrieve results.

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
There is a single include file ("rcli.h"). 

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
When building your client executable, you can either specify build flags by using the result of "rim -i" (if you have RimStone installed), or use self-contained source files directly.

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
It is MT-safe, so you can use it in multi-threaded applications, such as to make many requests in parallel.

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
It comes with messaging API (see \fBClient-API-and-messaging\fP).
.RE

See Examples section below for detailed examples.

.LP
.B SENDING A REQUEST TO RIMSTONE SERVICE
.LP

The following function is used to make a call using C API:

.RS 4
.EX

int rim_cli_request (rim_cli *req);

.EE
.RE

All input and output is contained in a single variable of type "rim_cli", the pointer to which is passed to "rim_cli_request()" function that sends a request to the service. A variable of type "rim_cli" must be initialized to zero before using it (such as with {0} initialization, "memset()" or "calloc()"), or otherwise some of its members may have random values:

.RS 4
.EX

// Define and initialize request variable
rim_cli req = {0};
// You could also do:
// memset ((char*)&req, 0, sizeof(rim_cli));
\[char46]..
// Set members of 'req' variable (see below)
\[char46]..
// Make a call
int result = rim_cli_request (&req);

.EE
.RE

Type "rim_cli" is defined as (i.e. public members of it):

.RS 4
.EX

typedef struct {
    const char *server; // the IP:port/socket_path to server
    const char *req_method; // request method
    const char *app_path; // application path
    const char *req; // request name
    const char *url_params; // URL params (path+query string)
    const char *content_type; // content type
    int content_len; // content len
    const char *req_body; // request body (i.e. content)
    char **env; // environment to pass to servicde
    int timeout; // timeout for request
    int req_status; // status of request from service
    int data_len; // length of response from service
    int error_len; // length of error from service
    char *errm; // error message when rim_cli_request returns other than RIM_OKAY
    rim_cli_out_hook out_hook; // hook to get data output as soon as it arrives
    rim_cli_err_hook err_hook; // hook get error output as soon as it arrives
    rim_cli_done_hook done_hook; // get all data when request is complete
    int thread_id; // custom ID when executing in a multithreaded fashion
    volatile char done; // indicator that the request has completed
    int return_code; // the return code from rim_cli_request()
} rim_cli;

.EE
.RE



.B - Mandatory input

The following members of "rim_cli" type must be supplied in order to make a call to a service:

.RS 4
\[bu]    
"server" represents either a Unix socket or a TCP socket, and is:

.RS 4
\[bu]    
for a Unix socket, a fully qualified name to a Unix socket file used to communicate with the service (use rim_dir() function to obtain it for any RimStone application, see below), or

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
for a TCP socket, a host name and port name in the form of "<host name>:<port number>", specifying where is the server listening on (for instance "127.0.0.1:2301" if the RimStone service is local and runs on TCP port 2301).
.RE


.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
"req_method" is a request method, such as "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE" or any other.

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
"app_path" is an application path (see \fBrequest\fP). By default it's "/<application name>". 

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
"req" is a request path, i.e. a request name preceded by a forward slash, as in "/<request name>" (see \fBrequest\fP).
.RE


.B - Get Unix socket file

To get Unix socket file path, use rim_dir() function, where "type" is the type of RimStone's file or directory, "dir" is the string buffer for the path, "dir_size" is its size, "app" is the application name, and "user" is Operating System user name who owns the application (NULL if your own):

.RS 4
.EX

size_t rim_dir (int type, char *dir, size_t dir_size, char *app, char *user);

.EE
.RE

Specifically to get the Unix socket file path, use RIM_DIR_SOCKFILE for "type" parameter, and with "app-name" being the application name owned by you:

.RS 4
.EX

char dir[RIM_MAX_OS_UDIR_LEN];
rim_dir (RIM_DIR_SOCKFILE, dir, sizeof(dir), "app-name", NULL);

.EE
.RE

Note that you can use RIM_DIR_USER to get user base directory (where all RimStone files are for a given user), RIM_DIR_APPS to get the directory under which all applications are, RIM_DIR_APP to get the directory under which all application files are, RIM_DIR_FILE to get the file directory, RIM_DIR_TRACE to get the directory where stack trace files are, and RIM_DIR_BLD to get the directory where RimStone application executables are (see \fBdirectories\fP). 


.B - URL parameters

"url_params" is the URL parameters, meaning input parameters (as path segments and query string, see \fBrequest\fP). URL parameters can be NULL or empty, in which case it is not used.


.B - Request body (content)

"req_body" is the request body, which can be any text or binary data. "content_type" is the content type of request body (for instance "application/json" or "image/jpg"). "content_len" is the length of request body in bytes. A request body is sent only if "content_type" and "req_body" are not NULL and not empty, and if "content_len" is greater than zero.


.B - Passing environment to service

"env" is any environment variables that should be passed along to the service. You can access those in RimStone via "environment" clause of \fBget-sys\fP statement. This is an array of strings, where name/value pairs are specified one after the other, and which always must end with NULL. For example, if you want to use variable "REMOTE_USER" with value "John" and variable "MY_VARIABLE" with value "8000", then it might look like this:

.RS 4
.EX

char *env[5];
env[0] = "REMOTE_USER";
env[1] = "John"
env[2] = "MY_VARIABLE";
env[3] = "8000"
env[4] = NULL;

.EE
.RE

Thus, if you are passing N environment variables to the service, you must size "env" as "char*" array with 2*N+1 elements. 

Note that in order to suppress output of HTTP headers from the service, you can include environment variable "RIM_SILENT_HEADER" with value "yes"; to let the service control headers output (either by default, with "-z" option of \fBmrim\fP or with \fBsilent-header\fP) simply omit this environment variable.


.B - Timeout

"timeout" is the number of seconds a call to the service should not exceed. For instance if the remote service is taking too long or if the network connection is too slow, you can limit how long to wait for a reply. If there is no timeout, then "timeout" value should be zero. Note that DNS resolution of the host name (in case you are using a TCP socket) is not counted in timeout. Maximum value for timeout is 86400.

Even if timeout is set to 0, a service call may eventually timeout due to underlying socket and network settings. Note that even if your service call times out, the actual service executing may continue until it's done.

.B - Thread ID

"thread_id" is an integer that you can set and use when your program is multithreaded. By default it's 0. This number is set by you and passed to hooks (your functions called when request is complete or data available). You can use this number to differentiate the data with regards to which thread it belongs to.


.B - Completion indicator and return code

When your program is multithreaded, it may be useful to know when (and if) a request has completed. "done" is set to "true" when a request completes, and "return_code" is the return value from rim_cli_request() (see below for a list). In a single-threaded program, this information is self-evident, but if you are running more than one request at the same time (in different threads), you can use these to check on each request executing in parallel (for instance in a loop in the main thread).

Note that "done" is "true" specifically when all the results of a request are available and the request is about to be completed. In a multithreaded program, it means the thread is very soon to terminate or has already terminated; it does not mean that thread has positively terminated. Use standard "pthread_join()" function to make sure the thread has terminated if that is important to you. 

.LP
.B RETURN VALUE OF RIM_CLI_REQUEST()
.LP

The following are possible return values from "rim_cli_request()" (available in "return_code" member of "rim_cli" type):

.RS 4

.RE

You can obtain the error message (corresponding to the above return values) in "errm" member of "rim_cli" type.

.LP
.B SERVER REPLY
.LP

The service reply is split in two. One part is the actual result of processing (called "stdout" or standard output), and that is "data". The other is the error messages (called "stderr" or standard error), and that's "error". All of service output goes to "data", except from \fBreport-error\fP and \fBprint-format\fP (with "to-error" clause) which goes to "error". Note that "data" and "error" streams can be co-mingled when output by the service, but they will be obtained separately. This allows for clean separation of output from any error messages.

You can obtain service reply when it's ready in its entirety (likely most often used), or as it comes alone bit by bit (see more about asynchronous hooks further here).

.LP
.B STATUS OF REQUEST EXECUTION
.LP

"req_status" member of "rim_cli" type is the request status when a request had executed; it is somewhat similar to an exit status of a program. A RimStone service request returns status by means of \fBexit-status\fP statement. Note that "req_status" is valid only if "rim_cli_request()" returned RIM_OKAY (or if "return_code" is RIM_OKAY for multi-threaded programs).

.LP
.B GETTING DATA REPLY (STDOUT)
.LP

Data returned from a request is valid only if "rim_cli_request()" returned RIM_OKAY (or if "return_code" is RIM_OKAY for multi-threaded programs). In that case, use "rim_cli_data()" function, for example:

.RS 4
.EX

// Declare and initialize request variable
rim_cli req = {0};
// Setup the req variable
\[char46]..
// Execute request
if (rim_cli_request (&req) == RIM_OKAY) {
    char *data = rim_cli_data (req); // data response
    int data_len = req->data_len; // length of data response in bytes
}

.EE
.RE

"data_len" member of "rim_cli" type will have the length of data response in bytes. The reply is always null-terminated as a courtesy, and "data_len" does not include the terminating null byte.

"rim_cli_data()" returns the actual response (i.e. data output) from service as passed to "data" stream. Any output from service will go there, except when "to-error" clause is used in \fBprint-format\fP - use these constructs to output errors without stopping the service execution. Additionally, the output of \fBreport-error\fP will also not go to data output.

.LP
.B GETTING ERROR REPLY (STDERR)
.LP

An error reply returned from a service is valid only if "rim_cli_request()" returned RIM_OKAY (or if "return_code" is RIM_OKAY for multi-threaded programs). In that case, use "rim_cli_error()" function, for example:

.RS 4
.EX

// Declare and initialize request variable
rim_cli req = {0};
// Setup the req variable
\[char46]..
// Execute request
if (rim_cli_request (&req) == RIM_OKAY) {
    char *err = rim_cli_error (req); // error response
    int err_len = req->error_len; // length of error response in bytes
}

.EE
.RE

"rim_cli_error()" returns any error messages from a service response, i.e. data passed to "error" stream. It is comprised of any service output when "to-error" clause is used in \fBprint-format\fP, as well as any output from \fBreport-error\fP. 

"error_len" member (of "rim_cli" type above) will have the length of error response in bytes. The response is always null-terminated as a courtesy, and "error_len" does not include the terminating null byte.

.LP
.B FREEING THE RESULT OF A REQUEST
.LP

Once you have obtained the result of a request, and when no longer needed, you should free it by using "rim_cli_delete()":

.RS 4
.EX

// Declare and initialize request variable
rim_cli req = {0};
// Setup the req variable
\[char46]..
// Execute request
rim_cli_request (&req);
// .. Use the result ..
// Free request output (data and error streams)
rim_cli_delete (&req);

.EE
.RE

If you do not free the result, your program may experience a memory leak. If your program exits right after issuing any request(s), you may skip freeing results as that is automatically done on exit by the Operating System. 

You can use "rim_cli_delete()" regardless of whether "rim_cli_request()" returned RIM_OKAY or not.

.LP
.B COMPLETION HOOK
.LP

A function you wrote can be called when a request has completed. This is useful in multithreaded invocations, where you may want to receive complete request's results as they are available. To specify a completion hook, you must write a C function with the following signature and assign it to "done_hook" member of "rim_cli" typed variable:

.RS 4
.EX

typedef void (*rim_cli_done_hook)(char *recv, int recv_len, char *err, int err_len, rim_cli *req);

.EE
.RE

"recv" is the request's data output, "recv_len" is its length in bytes, "err" is the request's error output, and "err_len" is its length in bytes. "req" is the request itself which you can use to obtain any other information about the request. In a single threaded environment, these are available as members of the request variable of "rim_cli" type used in the request, and there is not much use for a completion hook. 

See an example with asynchronous hooks.

.LP
.B ASYNCHRONOUS HOOKS
.LP

You can obtain the service's reply as it arrives by specifying read hooks. This is useful if the service supplies partial replies over a period of time, and your application can get those partial replies as they become available.

To specify a hook for data output (i.e. from stdout), you must write a C function with the following signature and assign it to "out_hook":

.RS 4
.EX

typedef void (*rim_cli_out_hook)(char *recv, int recv_len, rim_cli *req);

.EE
.RE

"recv" is the data received and "recv_len" is its length.

To specify a hook for error output (i.e. from stderr), you must write a C function with the following signature and assign it to "err_hook":

.RS 4
.EX

typedef void (*rim_cli_err_hook)(char *err, int err_len, rim_cli *req);

.EE
.RE

"err" is the error received and "err_len" is its length.

"req" (in both hooks) is the request itself which you can use to obtain any other information about the request.

To register these functions with "rim_cli_request()" function, assign their pointers to "out_hook" and "err_hook" members of request variable of type "rim_cli" respectively. Note that the output hook (i.e. hook function of type "rim_cli_out_hook") will receive empty string ("") in "recv" and "recv_len" will be 0 when the request has completed, meaning all service output (including error) has been received. 

For example, functions "get_output()" and "get_err()" will capture data as it arrives and print it out, and get_complete() will print the final result:

.RS 4
.EX

// Output hook
void get_output(char *d, int l, rim_cli *req)
{
    printf("Got output of [%.*s] of length [%d] in thread [%d]", l, d, l, req->thread_id);
}

// Error hook
void get_err(char *d, int l, rim_cli *req)
{
    printf("Got error of [%.*s] of length [%d], status [%d]", l, d, l, req->req_status);
}

// Completion hook
void get_complete(char *data, int data_len, char *err, int err_len, rim_cli *req)
{
    printf("Got data [%.*s] of length [%d] and error of [%.*s] of length [%d], status [%d], thread [%d]\\n", data_len, data, data_len, err_len, err, err_len, req->req_status, req->thread_id);
}

\[char46]..

rim_cli req = {0};
\[char46]..
// Register output and error hooks, as well as a completion hook
req.out_hook = &get_output;
req.err_hook = &get_err;
req.done_hook = &get_complete;

.LP
.B MULTITHREADING
.LP

The RimStone client is MT-safe, meaning you can use it both in single-threaded and multi-threaded programs. Note that each thread must have its own copy of "rim_cli" request variable, since it provides both input and output parameters to a request call and as such cannot be shared between the threads.

.LP
.B USAGE
.LP

Do not use this API directly with RimStone - use \fBcall-remote\fP instead which is made specifically for use in .rim files. Otherwise, you can use this API with any client program.

The following example is a simple demonstration, with minimum of options used. Copy the C code to file "cli.c" in a directory of its own:

.RS 4
.EX

\[char35]include "rcli.h"

void main ()
{
    // Request type rim_cli - create a request variable and zero it out
    rim_cli req = {0};

    // get socket file to communicate with server
    char dir[RIM_MAX_OS_UDIR_LEN];
    rim_dir (RIM_DIR_SOCKFILE, dir, sizeof(dir), "helloworld", NULL);
    req.server = dir;

    req.req_method = "GET"; // GET HTTP method
    req.app_path = "/helloworld"; // application path
    req.req = "/hello-simple"; // request name

    // Make a request
    int res = rim_cli_request (&req);

    // Check return status, and if there's an error, display error code and the
    // corresponding error message. Otherwise, print out service response.
    if (res != RIM_OKAY) printf("Request failed [%d] [%s]\\n", res, req.errm);
    else printf("%s", rim_cli_data(&req));

    // Free up resources so there are no memory leaks
    rim_cli_delete(&req);
}

.EE
.RE

To make this client application:

.RS 4
.EX

gcc -o cli cli.c $(rim -i)

.EE
.RE

In this case, you're using a Unix socket to communicate with the RimStone service. To test with a RimStone service handler, copy the following code to "hello_simple.rim" file in a separate directory:

.RS 4
.EX

begin-handler /hello_simple public

.B EXAMPLE WITH MORE OPTIONS
.LP

This example demonstrates using multiple options, including using TCP sockets connecting to a host and port number, environment variables, query string, request body and request execution timeout. It will also show the separation of "data" and "error" (i.e. stdout and stderr) streams from the service.

Copy this to file "cli1.c" in a directory of its own - note that in this example a server will run on localhost (127.0.0.1) and TCP port 2301:

.RS 4
.EX

    char *env[] = { "REMOTE_USER", "John", "SOME_VAR", "SOME\\nVALUE", "NEW_VAR", "1000", NULL };

    // Create a request
    // Environment variables to pass to service request
    req.env = env;
    // Server IP and port
    req.server = "127.0.0.1:2301";
    // Request method
    req.req_method = "GET";

    // Content type
    req.content_type = "application/json";
    // Content (i.e. request body)
    req.req_body = "This is request body";
    // Content length
    req.content_len = strlen (req.req_body);
    // No timeout (set to 0)
    req.timeout = 0;

    // Make a request
    int res = rim_cli_request (&req);

    // Check return status, and if there's an error, display error code and the
    // corresponding error message
    if (res != RIM_OKAY) printf("Request failed [%d] [%s]\\n", res, req.errm);
    else {
       // If successful, display request results
       // Exit code from the service processing
       printf("Server status %d\\n", req.req_status);
       // Length of reply from service
       printf("Len of data %d\\n", req.data_len);
       // Length of any error from service
       printf("Len of error %d\\n", req.error_len);
       // Reply from service
       printf("Data [%s]\\n", rim_cli_data(&req));
       // Any error message from service
       printf("Error [%s]\\n", rim_cli_error(&req));

The output shows service exit code (82, see \fBexit-status\fP in the RimStone code above), length of data output, and other information which includes environment variables passed to the service from the client, the PID of server process, the request body from the client, and then the error output. Note that the data output (stdout) and the error output (stderr) are separated, since the protocol does use separate streams over the same connection. This makes working with the output easy, while the data transfer is fast at the same time.
