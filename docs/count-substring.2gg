.SH NAME
count-substring \-  (strings)
.SH PURPOSE
Count substrings.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

count-substring <substring> in <string> to <count> [ case-insensitive [ <case insensitive> ] ]

.EE
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
count-substring counts the number of occurrences of <substring> in <string> and stores the result in <count> (specified in "to" clause). By default, search is case-sensitive. If you use "case-insensitive" clause without boolean variable <case insensitive>, or if <case insensitive> evaluates to true, then the search is case-insensitive.

If <substring> is empty (""), <count> is 0.

.SH EXAMPLES
In the following example, 1 occurrence will be found after the first count-substring, and 2 after the second (since case insensitive search is used there):

.RS 4
.EX

set-string sub = "world"
set-string str = "Hello world and hello World!"

count-substring sub in str to num_occ
print-format "Found %ld occurrences!\\n", num_occ

count-substring sub in str to num_occ case-insensitive
print-format "Found %ld occurrences!\\n", num_occ
