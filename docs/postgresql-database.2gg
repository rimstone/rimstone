.SH NAME
postgresql-database \- Golf documentation (database)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Postgres database configuration file has a Postgres connection string. 

You can see the parameters available at \fBhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING\fP. 

Most of the time, though, you may be using only a few of those options, as in:

.RS 4
.EX

user=myuser password=mypwd dbname=mydb

.EE
.RE

The above file has parameters "user" (Postgres user), "password" (the password for Postgres user), "dbname" (the Postgres database name). If you use peer-authenticated (i.e. passwordless) login, then omit "password" - this is when the Postgres user name is the same as your Operating System user name and where local unix domain socket is used for authentication.
