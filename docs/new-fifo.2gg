.SH DESCRIPTION
new-fifo initializes new FIFO <list> (First In First Out). 

<list> contains data stored on a first-in, first out basis. Note that a list is accessible to the current process only.

Information is retrieved (possibly many times, see \fBrewind-fifo\fP) in the same order in which it was stored.

The internal positions for \fBwrite-fifo\fP and \fBread-fifo\fP actions are separate so you can keep writing data to the list, and read it independently of writes in any number of retrieval passes by using \fBrewind-fifo\fP.
