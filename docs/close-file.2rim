.SH DESCRIPTION
close-file closes file <file id> previously opened with \fBopen-file\fP, where <file id> is an open file identifier.

You can obtain the status of file closing via <status> number (in "status" clause). The <status> is RIM_OKAY if file is closed, or RIM_ERR_CLOSE if could not close file.

If you do not close a file opened with open-file, RimStone will automatically close it when the request ends.
