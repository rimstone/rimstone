connect-haproxy-tcp-socket \- Golf documentation (web-servers)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This shows how to connect your application listening on TCP port <port number> (started with "-p" option in \fBmgrg\fP) to HAProxy load balancer.

One use of HAProxy is to balance the load between different web servers, which in turn are connected to your Golf applications; in this case HAProxy does not directly communicate with your Golf applications (which are behind other web servers).

However, when you want HAProxy to directly communicate with your Golf application servers, you may use configuration similar to this (shown is just a bare-bone setup needed to accomplish the goal, note sections "frontend", "fcgi-app" and "backend" that are relevant to Golf). The HAProxy configuration file is typically in "/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg":

Restart HAProxy:

.EX

sudo systemctl restart haproxy

Note that Golf application path is "/<your golf app name>" (and the application name may or may not be the same, see \fBrequest\fP). The TCP port of the application is "3000" (could be any port number you choose that's greater than 1000 and lower than 65535). 

HAProxy itself is bound to port 90 in this example (see "frontend" section above), and "path_reg" specifies which URLs will be passed to your Golf application (i.e. they must have "/<your golf app name>/" in the URL). "path-info" specifies SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO (as "()" regular sub-expressions), which are as such passed to your Golf application. "docroot" is set to the application home directory (see \fBdirectories\fP) in case you wish to serve HTML documents from it; however if you keep sensitive data there, specify another directory.

A Golf application (named "<your golf app name>") would have been started with (using the same application name "<your golf app name>" and TCP port "3000"):

.RS 4
.EX

mgrg -p 3000 <your golf app name>

.EE
.RE

Now you should be able to connect and load-balance your Golf application servers directly from HAProxy (which in this example listens on port 90, so you'd refer to it with https://your-web-server:90/<your golf app name>/...).
