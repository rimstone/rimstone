.SH DESCRIPTION
run-remote is a combination of \fBnew-remote\fP, \fBcall-remote\fP and \fBread-remote\fP in one. Clauses for each of those can be specified in any order. Only a single <service> can be used. If a call to <service> succeeds, its results are read. Use either:

.RS 4
\[bu]    
<status> (in "status" clause) to check if there are results to be read: if it is GG_OKAY, then you can use the results.

.RE

.RS 4
\[bu]    
<finished okay> (in "finished-okay" clause) to check if service call executed: if it's 1, then it has.
.RE

See details for each clause in \fBnew-remote\fP (for "local" through "timeout" clauses), \fBcall-remote\fP (for "status" through "finished-okay" clauses) and \fBread-remote\fP (for "data" through "exit-status" clauses).
