.SH DESCRIPTION
text-utf will convert string value <text> to UTF. <text> itself will hold the resulting UTF string. If you don't wish <text> to be modified, make a copy of it first (see \fBcopy-string\fP). See \fButf-text\fP for the reverse conversion and data standards information.

You can obtain <status> in "status" clause. <status> number is GG_OKAY if successful, or GG_ERR_UTF if there was an error, in which case <error text> string in "error-text" clause will contain the error message.
