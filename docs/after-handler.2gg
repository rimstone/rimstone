.SH PURPOSE
Execute your code after a request is handled.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Every Golf request goes through a request dispatcher (see \fBrequest\fP()). In order to specify your code to execute after a request is handled, create source file "after-handler.golf" and implement a handler that starts with "after-handler" and ends with "end-after-handler", which will be automatically picked up and compiled with your application. 

If no request executes (for example if your application does not handle a given \fBrequest\fP), after-handler handler does not execute either. If you use \fBexit-handler\fP to exit current request handling, after-handler handler still executes.

.SH EXAMPLES
Here is a simple implementation of after-handler handler that just outputs "Hi there!!":

.RS 4
.EX

after-handler
     @Hi there!! 
end-after-handler
