.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
.B WITHOUT FILE-ID
.LP

This is a simple method of reading a file. File named <file> is opened, data read, and file is closed. 

<file> can be a full path name, or a path relative to the application home directory (see \fBdirectories\fP).

Data read is stored into string <content>. Note that file can be binary or text and <content> may have null-bytes. 

If "position" and "length" clauses are not specified, read-file reads the entire <file> into <content>.

If "position" clause is used, then reading starts at byte <position>, otherwise it starts at the beginning of the file. Position of zero (0) represents the beginning of the file. 

If "length" clause is used, then <length> number of bytes is read, otherwise the rest of the file is read. If <length>  is 0, <content> is empty string and <status> is 0.

If "status" clause is used, then the number of bytes read is stored to <status>, unless error occurred, in which case <status> is negative and has the error code. The error code can be RIM_ERR_POSITION (if <position> is negative, outside the file, or file does not support it), RIM_ERR_READ (if <length> is negative or there is an error reading file) or RIM_ERR_OPEN if file cannot be opened. If the number of bytes read isn't what's requested, you can use "end-of-file" clause to get boolean <eof>, which is true if the end of file happened, or false if there is an error (in which case you can use "errno" clause in \fBget-req\fP to obtain the actual reason for error).

.LP
.B WITH FILE-ID
.LP

This method uses a <file id> that was created with \fBopen-file\fP. You can then read (and write) file using this <file id> and the file stays open until \fBclose-file\fP is called, or the \fBrequest\fP ends (i.e. RimStone will automatically close any such open files). 

Data read is stored into string <content>. Note that file can be binary or text and <content> may have null-bytes. 

If "position" clause is used, then data is read starting from byte <position> (with position of 0 being the first byte), otherwise reading starts from the current file position determined by the previous reads/writes or as set by using "set" clause in \fBfile-position\fP. Note that after each read or write, the file position is advanced by the number of bytes read or written.

If "length" clause is used, then <length> number of bytes is read, otherwise the rest of the file is read. If <length>  is 0, <content> is empty string and <status> is 0.

Note that when you reach the end of file and no more bytes can be read, <status> is 0.

If "status" clause is used, then the number of bytes read is stored to <status>, unless error occurred, in which case <status> has the error code. The error code can be RIM_ERR_POSITION (if <position> is negative, outside the file, or file does not support it), RIM_ERR_READ (if <length> is negative or there is an error reading file) or RIM_ERR_OPEN if file is not open. If the number of bytes read isn't what's requested, you can use "end-of-file" clause to get boolean <eof>, which is true if the end of file happened, or false if there is an error (in which case you can use "errno" clause in \fBget-req\fP to obtain the actual reason for error).

.SH EXAMPLES
To read the entire file and create both the variable that holds its content and the status variable:

.RS 4
.EX

read-file "/home/user/some_file" to file_content status st
if-true st greater-than 0
    @Read:
    @<hr/>
    print-out file_content web-encode
    @<hr/>
else-if
    @Could not read (<<print-format "%ld", st>>)
end-if

.EE
.RE

To read 10 bytes starting at position 20 (with position 0 being the first byte):

.RS 4
.EX

read-file "/home/user/some_file" to file_content position 20 length 10
