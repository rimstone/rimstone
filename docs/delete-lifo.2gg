.SH DESCRIPTION
delete-lifo will delete the most recently added elements to the LIFO <list> up to the last one read, including. <list> was created by \fBnew-lifo\fP. 

Right after \fBrewind-lifo\fP, no element was read yet, and delete-lifo will have no effect. Note that \fBwrite-lifo\fP also performs an implicit \fBrewind-lifo\fP.

After any \fBread-lifo\fP, delete-lifo wil delete all elements up to the element read, including that element.
