.SH DESCRIPTION
quit-process will properly terminate the current request and its running process (be it \fBservice\fP or \fBcommand-line\fP). It does that by sending itself a SIGTERM signal and then executing the process wind-down.

quit-process may be used to stop the service processes (or restart them if setup) in rare cases where you wish to do so programmatically instead of using \fBmgrg\fP.
