.SH DESCRIPTION
derive-key derives <key> from string <source> in "from" clause. If <source length> in "from-length" clause is specified, exactly <source length> bytes of <source> are used. Otherwise, the length of <source> string is used as the number of bytes (see \fBstring-length\fP). 

The desired length of derived key is given by <length> in "length" clause. The method for key generation is PBKDF2. By default the digest used is "SHA256". You can use a different <digest algorithm> in "digest" clause (for example "SHA3-256"). To see a list of available digests:

.RS 4
.EX

\[char35]get digests
openssl list -digest-algorithms

The salt for key derivation can be given with <salt> in "salt" clause. If "salt-length" clause is not specified, then the entire length of salt is used (see \fBstring-length\fP), otherwise <salt length> bytes are used as salt.

The number of iterations is given by <iterations> in "iterations" clause. The default is 1000 per \fBRFCÂ 8018\fP, though depending on your needs and the quality of <source> you may choose a different value.

By default, the derived key is produced in a hexadecimal form, where each byte is encoded as two-character hexadecimal characters, so its length is 2*<length>. If "binary" clause is used without boolean variable <binary>, or if <binary> evaluates to true, then the output is a binary string of <length> bytes.

Key derivation is often used when storing password-derivatives in the database (with salt), and also for symmetrical key generation.

.SH EXAMPLES
Derived key is in variable "mk":

.RS 4
.EX

random-string to rs9 length 16
derive-key mk from "clave secreta" digest "sha-256" salt rs9 salt-length 10 iterations 2000 length 16
