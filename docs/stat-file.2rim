.SH PURPOSE

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

stat-file <file> \\
    [ size <size> ] [ type <type> ] \\
    [ path <path> ] [ name <name> ] \\
    [ mode <mode> ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
stat-file obtains information about <file>, which is a string that is an absolute or relative path.

Clause "size" will store file's size in bytes to number <size>, or it will be RIM_ERR_FAILED (if operation failed, likely because file does not exist or you have no permissions to access it). 

Clause "type" will store file's type to number <type>, and it can be either RIM_FILE (if it's a file) or RIM_DIR (if it's a directory) or RIM_ERR_FAILED (if operation failed, likely because file does not exist or you have no permissions to access it). 

Clause "path" (in string <path>) obtains the fully resolved path of the <file> (including symbolic links), and "name" will provide its <name> (meaning a basename, without the path). If path cannot be resolved, then <path> is an empty string.

Clause "mode" will store file's permission mode to number <mode>, see \fBpermissions\fP.

.SH EXAMPLES
To get file size in variable "sz", which is created here:

.RS 4
.EX

stat-file "/home/user/file" size sz

.EE
.RE

To determine if the object is a file or a directory:

.RS 4
.EX

stat-file "/home/user/some_name" type what
if-true what equal RIM_FILE
   @It's a file!
else-if what equal RIM_DIR
   @It's a directory!
else-if
   @Doesn't exist!
end-if

.EE
.RE

Get the fully resolved path of a file to string variable "fp" and the name of the file:

.RS 4
.EX

stat-file "../file" path fp name fn
