start-loop \-  (program-flow)
.SH PURPOSE
Loop execution based on a condition.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

start-loop  [ repeat <repeat> ] \\
    [ use <loop counter> \\
        [ start-with <start with> ] [ add <add> ] ] 

    <any code>
    
end-loop

.SH DESCRIPTION
start-loop will execute code between start-loop and "end-loop" clauses certain number of times based on a condition specified and the usage of \fBcontinue-loop\fP and \fBbreak-loop\fP, which can be used in-between the two.

<repeat> number (in <repeat> clause) specifies how many times to execute the loop (barring use of \fBcontinue-loop\fP and \fBbreak-loop\fP).

<loop counter> (in "use" clause) is a number that by default starts with value of 1, and is incremented by 1 each time execution loops back to start-loop, unless "start-with" and/or "add" clauses are used. 

If <start with> (in "start-with" clause) is used, that's the initial value for <loop counter> (instead of the default 1), and if <add> is specified (in "add" clause), then <loop counter> is incremented by <add> each time execution loops back to start-loop (instead of the default 1).

If either of "start-with" or "add" clauses is used, then "use" must be specified.

.SH EXAMPLES
Print numbers 0 through 19:

.RS 4
.EX

start-loop repeat 20 use p start-with 0
    p-num p
    @
end-loop

.EE
.RE

A loop that is controlled via \fBcontinue-loop\fP and \fBbreak-loop\fP statements, displaying numbers from 1 through 30 but omitting those divisible with 3:

.RS 4
.EX

set-number n
set-number max = 30
start-loop
    set-number n add 1    
    if-true n mod 3
        continue-loop
    end-if
    if-true n greater-than max
        break-loop
    end-if
    p-num n
end-loop
