.SH NAME
delete-string \-  (strings)
.SH PURPOSE
Free string memory.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

delete-string <string>

.SH DESCRIPTION
delete-string frees <string> variable previously allocated by a Golf statement. 

Note that freeing memory is in most cases unnecessary as Golf will automatically do so at the end of each request. You should have a good reason for using delete-string otherwise.

Golf keeps count of <string> references for process-scoped memory (see \fBmemory-handling\fP), and such memory will be deleted at the end of the request once reference count reaches zero. 

For non-process-scoped memory, if <string> is referenced by other variables, then <string> may not be deleted. Regardless of whether the memory referenced by <string> is actually deleted or not, <string> becomes an empty string ("") after delete-string.

.SH EXAMPLES
Allocate and free random string:

.RS 4
.EX

random-string to ran_str
\[char46]..
delete-string ran_str

.EE
.RE

.RS 4
.EX

write-string ws
    start-loop repeat 100
        @Hello World
    end-loop
end-write-string
\[char46]..
