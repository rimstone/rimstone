.SH NAME
hash-string \-  (encryption)
.SH PURPOSE
Hash a string.

.SH SYNTAX

.RS 4
.EX

hash-string <string> to <result> \\
    [ binary [ <binary> ] \\
    [ digest <digest algorithm> ]

.EE
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
hash-string produces by default a SHA256 hash of <string> (if "digest" clause is not used), and stores the result into <result>. You can use a different <digest algorithm> in "digest" clause (for example "SHA3-256"). To see a list of available digests:

.RS 4
.EX

\[char35]get digests
openssl list -digest-algorithms

.EE
.RE

If "binary" clause is used without boolean variable <binary>, or if <binary> evaluates to true, then the <result> is a binary string that may contain null-characters. With the default SHA256, it is 32 bytes in length, while for instance with SHA3-384 it is 48 bytes in length, etc. 

Without "binary" clause, or if <binary> evaluates to false, each binary byte of hashed string is converted to two hexadecimal characters ("0"-"9" and "a"-"f"), hence <result> is twice as long as with "binary" clause. 

.SH EXAMPLES
String "result" will have a hashed value of the given string, an example of which might look like "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855":

.RS 4
.EX

hash-string "hello world" to hash

.EE
.RE

Using a different digest:

.RS 4
.EX

hash-string "hello world" to hash digest "sha3-384"

.EE
.RE

Producing a binary value instead of a null-terminated hexadecimal string:

.RS 4
.EX

hash-string "hello world" to hash digest "sha3-384" binary
