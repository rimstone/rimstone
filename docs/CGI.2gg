CGI \- Golf documentation (running-application)
.SH DESCRIPTION
You can run Golf application as a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) program, if your web server supports CGI. This is not recommended in general, as CGI programs do not exhibit great performance. However in some cases you may need to use CGI, such as when performance is not of critical importance, or when other methods of execution are not feasible.

To run your application with CGI, use \fBcommand-line\fP program. Since Golf applications require running in the security context of the user who owns the application, you must use "suexec" (or similar feature) of your web server.

The following script sets up an application named "func_test" (any kind of application will do) to run as CGI (after it's been compiled with \fBgg\fP) on Apache web server running on Ubuntu 18 and up. For other web servers/distros, consult their documentation on how to setup CGI for a program.

\[char35]prep repos
    sudo apt update

\[char35]enable CGI on apache
    sudo a2enmod cgid

\[char35]Install suexec-custom for Apache
    sudo apt-get -y install apache2-suexec-custom
    sudo a2enmod suexec
    sudo service apache2 restart

\[char35]setup a "gg" directory under cgi-bin where your application can run
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/cgi-bin/gg
    sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami)  /usr/lib/cgi-bin/gg
    sudo sed -i '1c\\/usr/lib/cgi-bin/gg' /etc/apache2/suexec/www-data

\[char35]copy your program to "gg" directory
    sudo mv $HOME/.golf/apps/func-test/.bld/func-test /usr/lib/cgi-bin/gg
    sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami)  /usr/lib/cgi-bin/gg/func-test
    sudo chmod 700  /usr/lib/cgi-bin/gg/func-test

\[char35]add user/group of Gliim application user to suexec    
    sudo sed -i "/SuexecUserGroup/d" /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    sudo sed -i "s/<\\/VirtualHost>/SuexecUserGroup $(whoami) $(whoami)\\n<\\/VirtualHost>/g" /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    sudo service apache2 restart
