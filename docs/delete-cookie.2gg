.SH DESCRIPTION
delete-cookie marks a cookie named <cookie name> for deletion, so it is sent back in the reply telling the client (such as browser) to delete it. 

Newer client implementations require a cookie deletion to use a secure context if the cookie is considered secure, and it is recommended to use "secure" clause to delete such a cookie. This is the case when either "secure" clause is used without boolean variable <secure>, or if <secure> evaluates to true.

<cookie name> is a cookie that was either received from the client as a part of the request, or was added with \fBset-cookie\fP. 

A cookie can be deleted before or after header is sent out (see \fBout-header\fP). However a cookie must be deleted prior to outputting any actual response (such as with \fBoutput-statement\fP or \fBprint-out\fP for example), or the request will error out (see \fBerror-handling\fP).

<status> (in "status" clause) is a number that will be GG_ERR_EXIST if the cookie did not exist, or GG_OKAY if it did.

The same cookie name may be stored under different URL paths. You can use "path" clause to specify <cookie path> to ensure the desired cookie is deleted.
